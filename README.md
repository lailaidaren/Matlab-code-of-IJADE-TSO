# Matlab-code-of-IJADE-TSO
Abstract
This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called IJADE-TSO, by hybridizing an improved adaptive differential evolution with optional external archive (IJADE) and the tuna swarm optimization (TSO). The spiral foraging search and parabolic foraging search of TSO are introduced into the mutation strategy in IJADE to improve the exploration ability and population diversity. In addition, this paper adds the crossover factor (CR) ranking, CR repairing, top Î± r1 selection, and population linear reduction strategies to improve the convergence efficiency. The proposed IJADE-TSO algorithm is tested using the CEC 2014 test set by comparing with state-of-the-art competitors. Moreover, IJADE-TSO is applied in solving photovoltaic parameter identification by comparing with well-known algorithms on photovoltaic parameter identification problems in recent years. The statistical results show that IJADE-TSO is more promising than the compared algorithms.
